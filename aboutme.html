<h1>Nia C. Sanchez</h1>
<p>I'll be completely honest, I don't have the most exciting life.</p>
<p>But, there are some things I like to do. Like draw. Here's some random stuff I decided to draw! I'm still learning, so I mostly freehand other things I see on the internet.</p>

<p>I'm not the best, but trust me, I used to be worse. XD I also really love dogs. 
  Cats are cool, but I'm really a dog person. </p>

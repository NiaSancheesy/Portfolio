        <p>I'll be completely honest, I don't have the most exciting life.</p>
        <p>But, there are some things I like to do. Like draw. Here's some random stuff I decided to draw! I'm still learning, so I mostly freehand other things I see on the internet.</p>
        <img src="Belle.jpg" alt="bleh" width="200" height="250"> <img src="Bubble Goldfish.jpg" alt="bleh" width="200" height="250"> <img src="Red Heart.jpg" alt="bleh" width="200" height="250">

        <p>I'm not the best, but trust me, I used to be worse. I also really love dogs.</p>
